# Gonzalo Stoll portfolio

This website is my old personal [portfolio](https://personal-portfolio-ashen.vercel.app), done with React, TypeScript, Tailwind and vitejs.

## Development

To run this website locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and you should be ready to go!
